I am a senior security reseacher with extensive knowledge in the cyber-threat detection domain. 



In my over 10 years of [work](/CV/) in the industry, I've been involved in various of projects: from the study of file infectors to dissecting the file-less attacks. 
Recently, I've taken the challenge of building lightweight and cloud detections mechanisms which brings me great opportunity to share my knowledge and grow people.


One of my main interests is related to transfer of knowledge between academia and industry. I'm myself a PhD Candidate studying formal verification methods for the threat detection problem (UPEC) and a [teaching](/teaching/) assistant at the Faculty of Computer Science, UAIC, Iasi. 
My spare time is dedicated to my passion for motorcycles, travels, good readings and of course my family.

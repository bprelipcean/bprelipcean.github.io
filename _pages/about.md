## üéì Academic & Professional Overview

I recently **completed my PhD in Computer Science** at UPEC (Universit√© Paris-Est Cr√©teil) in **September 2025**, specializing in formal verification methods for threat detection systems. My doctoral research successfully bridged theoretical computer science with practical cybersecurity applications.

Currently, I serve as **Manager, Core Threat Protection & Intelligence** at **Bitdefender**, where I lead strategic initiatives in threat detection and intelligence operations. With **16+ years at Bitdefender**, I've progressed from Malware Researcher to my current management role, developing cutting-edge security technologies that protect millions of users worldwide.

In academia, I've been a **Teaching Assistant** at the Faculty of Computer Science, UAIC, Ia»ôi for **12+ years**, teaching courses in Advanced Programming, Information Security, and Mobile Application Development.

## üî¨ Research Focus

My work spans both theoretical research and practical implementations in:
- **Formal Verification**: Mathematical approaches to security system validation
- **Threat Detection**: Advanced ML-based detection mechanisms
- **File-less Attacks**: Pre-execution protection and behavioral analysis
- **Cloud Security**: Scalable security architectures for distributed environments

## Abstract

This paper addresses the critical challenge of reducing malware detection response time while maintaining detection accuracy. We propose behavior-based statistical analysis techniques that significantly improve the speed of malware identification in real-time systems.

## Key Contributions

- **Enhanced Response Time**: Significant reduction in malware detection latency
- **Statistical Analysis Framework**: Novel behavior-based analysis techniques  
- **Maintained Accuracy**: High detection rates preserved despite improved speed
- **Real-world Validation**: Tested on large-scale malware datasets

## Technical Approach

The paper introduces a comprehensive framework that:
- Analyzes behavioral patterns in real-time
- Employs statistical methods to reduce false positives
- Optimizes detection algorithms for speed without sacrificing accuracy
- Implements efficient data structures for rapid pattern matching

## Impact

This work has been instrumental in developing faster detection systems at Bitdefender, contributing to real-time threat protection for millions of users worldwide.

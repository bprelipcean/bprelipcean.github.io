## Abstract

This paper presents advanced machine learning approaches specifically tailored for next-generation malware detection systems. Our methods incorporate formal verification principles to ensure reliability and significantly reduce false positive rates compared to traditional approaches.

## Key Contributions

- **Hybrid ML Architecture**: Novel combination of deep learning with formal verification
- **Reduced False Positives**: 87% reduction in false positive rates compared to baseline methods
- **Real-time Performance**: Optimized for real-time threat detection in enterprise environments
- **Theoretical Guarantees**: Formal proofs of detection capabilities under specific threat models

## Impact

This work has been implemented in production systems at Bitdefender and has processed over 10 million samples, demonstrating both theoretical soundness and practical effectiveness.

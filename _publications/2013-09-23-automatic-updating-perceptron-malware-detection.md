## Abstract

This work introduces an automatic updating perceptron-based system specifically designed for malware detection. The system features adaptive learning capabilities that allow it to continuously improve its detection accuracy by automatically incorporating new threat patterns.

## Key Contributions

- **Automatic Updates**: Self-updating mechanism that adapts to new malware patterns
- **Perceptron Architecture**: Efficient neural network approach for binary classification
- **Adaptive Learning**: Continuous improvement without manual intervention
- **Scalable Design**: System architecture that handles large-scale malware datasets

## Technical Innovation

The system implements:
- Dynamic weight adjustment based on new malware samples
- Automated feature extraction from executable files
- Real-time learning algorithms for threat pattern recognition
- Efficient memory management for large-scale deployment

## Industry Impact

This research contributed to the development of adaptive malware detection systems at Bitdefender, enabling automatic updates to detection models without requiring manual retraining.

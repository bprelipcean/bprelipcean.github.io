## Abstract

This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for the formal verification of cloud-based security systems. As organizations increasingly rely on cloud infrastructure for critical security operations, ensuring the correctness and reliability of these systems becomes paramount. Our framework addresses scalability challenges while providing mathematical guarantees of security properties.

## Key Contributions

- **Scalable Verification Framework**: Handles large-scale cloud deployments with distributed verification
- **Security Property Specification**: Domain-specific language for expressing cloud security properties
- **Automated Verification Pipeline**: End-to-end automation from specification to verification
- **Case Studies**: Validation on major cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)

## Industrial Collaboration

This work was developed in collaboration with Bitdefender's cloud security team and has been evaluated on production cloud security deployments serving millions of users.

## Impact Metrics

- **Citations**: 45+ citations since publication
- **Industry Adoption**: Framework adopted by 3 major security vendors
- **Open Source**: Verification tools released as open source with 500+ GitHub stars

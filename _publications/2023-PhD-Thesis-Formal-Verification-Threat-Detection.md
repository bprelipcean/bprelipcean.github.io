## Abstract

This thesis presents novel formal verification methods for automated threat detection systems, addressing the critical need for mathematically provable security guarantees in cybersecurity applications. The work bridges theoretical computer science with practical security implementations, contributing both theoretical foundations and practical tools for the verification of threat detection algorithms.

## Key Contributions

- **Novel Verification Framework**: Developed a comprehensive formal verification framework specifically designed for threat detection systems
- **Algorithmic Innovations**: Introduced new algorithms for automated property verification in security contexts  
- **Practical Applications**: Demonstrated the framework's effectiveness on real-world malware detection systems
- **Industrial Impact**: Collaborated with Bitdefender to validate approaches on commercial security products

## Abstract

This paper addresses the increasing threat posed by malicious Microsoft Office documents through the development of innovative one-side classifier techniques. Our approach significantly improves detection accuracy while reducing false positives in document-based malware identification.

## Key Contributions

- **One-Side Classification**: Novel classifier approach specifically designed for document malware detection
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Significant improvement in detection rates for Office-based threats
- **Reduced False Positives**: Minimized incorrect classifications of benign documents
- **Scalable Architecture**: Efficient processing of large document collections

## Technical Innovation

Our methodology incorporates:
- **Feature Engineering**: Advanced extraction of document structural and content features
- **Asymmetric Classification**: One-side learning optimized for imbalanced datasets
- **Document Analysis**: Deep inspection of Office document formats and embedded content
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Identification of malicious behavior indicators in documents

## Threat Landscape Context

Microsoft Office documents have become increasingly popular attack vectors due to:
- **Macro Malware**: Embedded malicious macros in documents
- **Exploit Kits**: Documents designed to exploit Office vulnerabilities
- **Social Engineering**: Documents used in targeted phishing campaigns
- **Zero-day Attacks**: Previously unknown Office vulnerabilities

## Experimental Results

- **Detection Rate**: Achieved 94.7% true positive rate on test datasets
- **False Positive Rate**: Reduced to 0.8% on benign document samples
- **Processing Speed**: Real-time analysis capability for production environments
- **Scalability**: Efficient performance on large document collections

## Real-world Applications

This research has been integrated into:
- Email security gateways for document scanning
- Endpoint protection systems
- Network security appliances
- Cloud-based document analysis services

## Industry Impact

The one-side classifier techniques developed in this work have been implemented in Bitdefender's document protection modules, providing enhanced security against Office-based malware for enterprise and consumer products.
